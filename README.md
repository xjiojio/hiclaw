**Deploy a team of AI Agents in 5 minutes. Manager coordinates Workers, all visible in your IM.**

HiClaw is an open-source Agent Teams system built on [OpenClaw](https://github.com/nicepkg/openclaw). A Manager Agent acts as your AI chief of staff — it creates Workers, assigns tasks, monitors progress, and reports back. You stay in control, making decisions instead of babysitting agents.

```
You → Manager → Worker Alice (frontend)
             → Worker Bob   (backend)
             → Worker ...
```

All communication happens in Matrix Rooms. You see everything, and can intervene anytime — just like messaging a team in a group chat.

## Why HiClaw

**Security by design**: Workers never hold real API keys or GitHub PATs. They only carry a consumer token (like a badge). Even a compromised Worker can't leak your credentials.

**Truly open IM**: Built-in Matrix server means no Slack/Feishu bot approval process. Open Element Web in your browser, or use any Matrix client (Element, FluffyChat) on mobile — iOS, Android, Web.

**One command to start**: A single `curl | bash` sets everything up — Higress AI Gateway, Matrix server, file storage, web client, and the Manager Agent itself.

**Skills ecosystem**: Workers can pull from [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) (80,000+ community skills) on demand. Safe to use because Workers can't access real credentials anyway.

## Quick Start

```bash
bash <(curl -sSL https://higress.ai/hiclaw/install.sh)
```

That's it. The script asks for your LLM API key, then sets everything up. When it's done:

```
=== HiClaw Manager Started! ===
  Open: http://127.0.0.1:18088
  Login: admin / [generated password]
  Tell the Manager: "Create a Worker named alice for frontend dev"
```

**Windows (PowerShell 7+):**

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; Invoke-Expression ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://higress.ai/hiclaw/install.ps1'))
```

**Prerequisites**: Docker Desktop (Windows/macOS) or Docker Engine (Linux). That's all.

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (Windows / macOS)
- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (Linux) or [Podman Desktop](https://podman-desktop.io/) (alternative)

**Resource requirements**: The Docker VM needs at least 2 CPU cores and 4 GB RAM. In Docker Desktop, go to Settings → Resources to adjust.

### Non-interactive install

```bash
HICLAW_LLM_API_KEY="sk-xxx" HICLAW_NON_INTERACTIVE=1 bash <(curl -sSL https://higress.ai/hiclaw/install.sh)
```

### After install

1. Open `http://127.0.0.1:18088` in your browser
2. Login with the credentials shown during install
3. Tell the Manager to create a Worker and assign it a task

For mobile: download Element or FluffyChat, connect to your Matrix server address, and manage your agents from your phone.

## How It Works

### Manager as your AI chief of staff

The Manager handles the full Worker lifecycle through natural language:

```
You: Create a Worker named alice for frontend development

Manager: Done. Worker alice is ready.
         Room: Worker: Alice
         Tell alice what to build.

You: @alice implement a login page with React

Alice: On it... [a few minutes later]
       Done. PR submitted: https://github.com/xxx/pull/1
```

The Manager also runs periodic heartbeats — if a Worker gets stuck, it alerts you automatically.

### Security model

```
Worker (consumer token only)
    → Higress AI Gateway (holds real API keys, GitHub PAT)
        → LLM API / GitHub API / MCP Servers
```

Workers only see their consumer token. The gateway handles all real credentials. Manager knows what Workers are doing, but never touches the actual keys either.

### Human in the loop

Every Matrix Room has you, the Manager, and the relevant Workers. You can jump in at any point:

```
You: @bob wait, change the password rule to minimum 8 chars
Bob: Got it, updated.
Alice: Frontend validation updated too.
```

No black boxes. No hidden agent-to-agent calls.

## HiClaw vs OpenClaw Native

| | OpenClaw Native | HiClaw |
|---|---|---|
| Deployment | Single process | Distributed containers |
| Agent creation | Manual config + restart | Conversational |
| Credentials | Each agent holds real keys | Workers only hold consumer tokens |
| Human visibility | Optional | Built-in (Matrix Rooms) |
| Mobile access | Depends on channel setup | Any Matrix client, zero config |
| Monitoring | None | Manager heartbeat, visible in Room |
